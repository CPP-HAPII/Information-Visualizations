Whether or not I get into a car accident depends mostly on how good a driver I am.,,,,
"When I make plans, I am almost certain to make them work.",,,,
Often there is no chance of protecting my personal interests from bad luck happenings.,,,,
"When I get what I want, it's usually because I'm lucky.",,,,
"Although I might have good ability, I will not be given leadership responsibility without appealing to those in positions of power.",,,,
How many friends I have depends on how nice a person I am.,,,,

Getting what I want requires pleasing those people above me.,,,,
Whether or not I get to be a leader depends on whether I'm lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.,,,,

I am usually able to protect my personal interests.,,,,
Whether or not I get into a car accident depends mostly on the other driver.,,,,
"When I get what I want, it's usually because I worked hard for it.",,,,
"In order to have my plans work, I make sure that they fit in with the desires of people who have power over me.",,,,
My life is determined by my own actions.,,,,
It's chiefly a matter of fate whether or not I have a few friends or many friends.,,,,
